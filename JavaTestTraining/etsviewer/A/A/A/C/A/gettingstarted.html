<body><span style="font-weight: bold;">Getting Started</span><br><br>In
the "Test View" tree on the left, there are multiple categories of
tests - Standard Tests, &nbsp;Practice Tests, Objective wise Test, and
Custom Tests. Each category has multiple Tests. To take any of these
tests, just double click on the Test node. For example, double click
on&nbsp;Test 1 under Standard Test to start Test 1. You will be asked
to enter a name for this attempt. You can take any test any number of
times. Each attempt is showed right under the Test. For example,
&nbsp;if you take Test 1 with the name, First Attempt, you will see a
node named First Attempt under Test 1. <br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Standard Tests</span>
mimic the real test in terms of topic distribution, toughness level,
&nbsp;and time. &nbsp;You should start with the first standard test.
After taking the test, &nbsp;go through the explanations for each
question...even for the questions that you answered correctly. This is
because we try to put lot of useful information in the explanations,
which can help you understand the concept better. Identify the topics
in which you scored least and study those topics from any book. Develop
some sample programs to test out the concepts if necessary. &nbsp;Only
after you are comfortable with topics on which you scored least,
&nbsp;you should attempt the next test. Your goal is to increase the
scores on these topics on the next test. If you are able to pass all
the tests comfortably, you will pass the real test with flying colors!<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Practice Tests</span>
are useful when you want to check your level of preparation. It
contains Easy, Tough, and Very Tough tests. &nbsp;It may also contain a
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Most Missed Test</span>. This test
contains questions that are answered wrong the most by all the users of
this question bank. To use this test, you need internet connection
because it fetches the list of most missed questions dynamically from
our server.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Objective-wise Tests</span>
are useful when you are following a book and after each
chapter/topic/exam objective, you want to solve questions only from
that topic.<br><br>Finally, if you need something other than all the above types of tests, you can customize the tests under <span style="font-weight: bold;">Custom Tests</span>.
For example, if you want questions on two topics, just right click on
Custom Tests node and click on "Create New Test Criteria". &nbsp;Give a
name to the Test Criteria (e.g. My Test on topic 1 and 2). It will open
up a Criteria set up screen which is self explanatory. Once you create
this custom test criteria, you can take tests on this criteria just
like the other tests. In fact, all other tests are nothing but
pre-defined test criteria!<br><br><b>Note:</b> All the questions delivered by
various tests come from a single question bank. Thus, if you take an
Easy Test and then take a Standard Test, you might get questions that
you've already seen. However, <span style="font-weight: bold;">tests under Standard Tests are unique among themselves</span>
&nbsp;(i.e. questions in one standard test are not repeated in any
other standard test) and cover all the questions from the question
bank. <br><br><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;" class="titles2"></span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Best of luck,</span><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Enthuware Team.<br>support@enthuware.com</span></body></html>
